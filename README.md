# AngularThings

This project was done as a way to learn a group of technologies. It eventually came together as a reactive CRUD app with authentication. It doesn't really have a finised product with a purpose reason to exist. The goals I had for working on this app have been completed.

Uses Firebase on back end. Observables to the back end results in a reactive app needing no REST calls. Implements 2 Angular services and the Angular router.
